1) Login.jsx- used Material UI components for TextField, Button, Typography, Box, Paper.
2) Navbar.jsx - used Material UI box for navbar and  I use this function everywhere i need a navbar
3) Register.jsx - used Material UI components for TextField, Button, Typography, Box, Paper.
4) Used MUI to improve every single component - used a single navbar to import whenever needed , made a visually appealing lobby and followed a theme. 
5) used MUI x chart library to display charts - wasnt really able to test it due to my PlayGame component giving internal server error
